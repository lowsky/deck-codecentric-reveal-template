# even more
* starter kits for
* graphql in java/ruby/scala


## Examples:
Graffiti Relay TodoMVC application

### limits / any risks?
Ready for going productive?
* Reference implementation: graphql-js
* D.O.S. problem with complex queries
   - needs analysis tool on ast
* Missing:
> One thing it's missing is the ability to update clients reactively. In the GraphQL spec, there is no way to subscribe and get updates. There have been some experiments and discussion on how to do so, but we don't have any examples yet.
